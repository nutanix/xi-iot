# Using MQTT in Karbon Platform Services

MQTT How to has been split into the following tasks
### 1. datasource
This task covers how to create an MQTT datasource in Karbon Platform Services, which enables data pipelines to receive MQTT data from MQTT clients.
Once this task is completed, you will be able to:
1. Determine the MQTT topic on which datapipelines will receive data.
2. Download X509 certificates to be used in the MQTT client to enable secure communication.
3. Determine the IP address of the MQTT broker to publish and receive data from it.

### 2. client samples
This task covers how to use an MQTT client to publish data to a Karbon Platform Services edge. Please finish the previous task first before proceeding.
